# Water Fountain and Water Level Indicator Using DC Water Motor
This is a very basic project to make our concepts clear about resistor in series and parallel; current, voltage and Power of a circuit; Uses of battery and LEDs.  

Our goal is to make a Fountain In which LEDs will glow when water passes through it.  We used 4 water bottles of different levels, 16 LEDs connected with 16 resistor of 1kâ„¦. Water will be transferred from one bottle to another and so on until the 4th bottle fulfilled and water will fall into sink. There Are 4 LEDs in each bottle of 3V which are fixed at different levels of bottle to indicate the water level and to glow when water passes through it.
